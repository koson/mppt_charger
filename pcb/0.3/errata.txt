- Consider integrated half-bridge with sleep:
  BTN8982TAAUMA1 (50A heftig)
  bq500101 (10A, best) eller CSD97394Q4M (20A, høyere strøm)
  MPQ8039 (4.5A, SOIC-pakke)
- Change to I2C current/voltage sensor
- PIC32, PIC32MX170F256B? SSOP eller QFN
- Replaceable fuse for battery
- Low power 3.3 V converter, possibly 54202 or 62175?
- Remove LCD and button
- Add ideal diode to prevent back current?


Old:
- Re-add resistors on transistor gates
