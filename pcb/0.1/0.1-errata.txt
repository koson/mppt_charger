 - 27211A not pin compatible with IR2183:
   Rotate chip 180 degrees
   Move high side FET source connection from pin 6 to 8
   Low side input is not inverted
   Bootstrap-diode built in
 - Higher voltage FETs
 - LCD-footprint
 - Switch uC to PIC18LF26K20 or better
 - Add 0.1u ceramic caps close to switch (especially on input)
 - Room for more bulk capacitance and through hole caps
 - PTC fuse for battery
 - Ideal diode from inductor output to battery? Probably not necessary with PTC fuse
 - FET-switches directly connected to battery
 - Remove PV/BAT-selector
 - Replace screw holes with regular holes with copper ring
 - Solder pads for power connection
 - P-channel FET for LCD-LED connected to PWM-output
 - Switch mode regulator
 - JST-XH UART connector
 - Button-footprint
 - Change shunts to 3225-package
